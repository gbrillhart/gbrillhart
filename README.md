Hello! I'm Garrett Brillhart, a senior at Purdue University studying Computer Engineering. My main focus is on software development and digital logic through all levels.
This includes low-level assembly coding for microcontrollers, C coding for microcontrollers and computation-intensive algorithms, as well as more high-level development with Python in AI and Computer Security.
I have microcontroller experience with my senior design project, Sink or be Sunk (See our demonstration at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ziMwrT-h9pU&t=23s and our github at https://github.com/Sink-or-be-Sunk). I dealt mainly with programming the I/O for the microcontroller and the board in C. Much of the work was testing and experimenting with digital circuits on a breadboard and then implementing them through the Team PCB.
My Python experience stems mainly from a Computer Security and Intro to Aritficial Intelligence classes from Purdue University. In the security class, we wrote encryption algorithms, basic network attack programs, and exploitations. My Intro to Artifical Intelligence had many interesting projects, including a Pac-Man Min/Max AI, Sokoban puzzle solver, basic neural nets, and BlackJack learner.
